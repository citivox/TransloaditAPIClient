# A Transloadit API Wrapper for iOS

This is a refactored version of the [Transloadit iPhone
SDK](https://github.com/transloadit/iphone-sdk) powered by
AFNetworking and blocks.

## Getting started

To work with the API you will need a [transloadit](http://transloadit.com/) account, as well
as a [template id](http://transloadit.com/docs/templates).

In order to use the SDK in your own app, simply add
TransloaditAPIClient.[h|m] into your XCode project.

TransloaditAPIClient depends on
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/)

## A gentle introduction to the TransloaditAPIClient

**Initializing**

```objective-c
[[TransloaditAPIClient sharedClient] authenticateWithKey:@"<AUTH-KEY>" andSecret:@"<AUTH-SECRET>"];
[[TransloaditAPIClient sharedClient] setTemplateId:@"<TEMPLATE-ID>"];
```

**Uploading a picture selected from the UIImagePickerController**

```objective-c
- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
{
  [[TransloaditAPIClient sharedClient] uploadFileFromPicker:info];
}
```

**Uploading progress**

```objective-c
[[TransloaditAPIClient sharedClient] setUploadProgressBlock:^(NSInteger bytesWritten, long long totalBytesWritten, long long totalBytesExpectedToWrite) {
  NSLog(@"Sent %lld of %lld bytes", totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite);
  if (totalBytesWritten == totalBytesExpectedToWrite)
    NSLog(@"We are done uploading!");
}];
```

**Handling success and failure**

```objective-c
[[TransloaditAPIClient sharedClient] setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:^(NSDictionary *JSON) {
  NSLog(@"Transloadit's response: \n%@", [JSON description]);
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
  NSLog(@"Awww snap! Failed with error '%@'", [error localizedDescription]);
}];
```
